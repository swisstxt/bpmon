<p>Business Process Monitor that uses Icinga as service health source. BPMON allows
you to compose <em>Business Processes</em> (BPs) and their <em>Key Performance Indicators</em>
(KPIs) using the services you already have in Icinga! BPMON &hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>&hellip; <em>reads</em> the states of services defined, &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; <em>evaluates</em> those states, &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; feeds the results results to an InfluxDB in order to <em>keep track of the history</em> &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; and/or triggers a command to perform actions such as <em>alarming</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>BPMON does not need to be run as a server. Run BPMON via Jenkins, Cron or
manually as needed.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>To install BPMON, you need Go 1.7. Please refer to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">https://golang.org/doc/install</a>
to do so&hellip;</p>

<p>Simply run the following command (don&rsquo;t forget the three dots at the end!):</p>

<pre><code># go get -u github.com/unprofession-al/bpmon/...
</code></pre>

<h2 id="configure-bpmon">Configure BPMON</h2>

<p>BPMONs global settings are configured via a simple config file written in YAML.
The config file can hold multiple <em>sections</em> (separat configurations) that enables
a decent amount of flexibility in combination with YAMLs <em>anchors</em>. Let&rsquo;s have
a look at an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
# The default section is - as suggested - read by default. Note the '&amp;default'
# notation; this is known an an 'anchor' and allows you to reuse the settings
# in other sections...
default: &amp;default
  # First BPMON needs to have access to your Icinga2 API. Learn more on by reading 
  # https://docs.icinga.com/icinga2/latest/doc/module/icinga2/chapter/icinga2-api.
  checker:
    kind: icinga
    connection: https://user:pass@icinga.example.com:5665
  # Also the connection to the InfluxDB is required in order to persist the
  # state for reporting and such. 
  store:
    kind: influx
    connection: http://user:pass@influx.example.com:8086/bpmon
    # the timeout is read as a go (golang) duration, please refer to 
    # https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration for a detailed explanation.
    timeout: 2s
    # If a state is 'OK' only save it to InfluxDB if its an BP measurement 
    # (e.g. do not persist 'OK' states for KPIs and services for the sake of
    # a small amount of data). In that case BP 'OK' states are saved as 
    # 'heart beat' of BPMON.
    save_ok: [ BP ]
    # This will tell BPMON to compare the current status against the last 
    # status saved in InfluxDB and adds some values to the measurement 
    # accordingly. This then allows to generate reports such as 'Tell me
    # only when a status is changed from good to bad'. This only runs against
    # types listed in 'save_ok' since only these are persisted 'correctly'.
    get_last_status: true
  # global_recipient will be added to the repicient list af all BP
  global_recipient: admin
  # Define your office hours et al. according to your service level 
  # agreements (SLA). You can later reference them in your BP definitions.

<p>Run the following command to check your configuration and see how it comes
together with the defaults set by BPMON:</p>

<pre><code># bpmon -c [path_to_the_config] -s [name_of_the_section_to_check] config
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code># bpmon -c ./cfg.yaml -s default config
</code></pre>

<h2 id="define-business-processes">Define <em>Business Processes</em></h2>

<p>Now that BPMON is set up, lets define a <em>business process</em>. Again, we do that
via YAML, a file per <em>business process</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
# Give it a name. Names can be changed anytime...
name: Application X
# Also give it an ID. This is used to store results in the database and
# therefore should not be changed.
id: app_x
# Tell BPMON during what time the process needs to be avalable. Remember
# the availabilities section from the global configuration...? This links 
# there.
availability: 9to5
# You can also specify a 'responsible' string. This string can then be used in
# the trigger template. This could be for example trigger a specific http
# end point, pass some uri parameters, send an email to a specific address etc.
# The 'responsible' string is inherited by its KPIs if not overwritten...
responsible: app.team@example.com
# By providing a list of 'recipients' subcommands such as 'beta dashboard' can
# use that information in order do provide some sort of authorization.
recipients: [ UsersAppX ]
# Now the KPIs...
kpis:
  - 
    # We already know the name and ID part...
    name: Load Balancer Availability
    id: lb_availability
    # The 'operatinon' defines how the services must be evaluated. Possible
    # options are:
    # * AND:          All services need to be 'OK' for the KPI to be 'OK'.
    # * OR:           At least one sf its services needs to fo 'OK'.
    # * MIN x:        Where x is an integer. A minimum number of x services
    #                 need to be 'OK'
    # * MINPERCENT x:  As 'MIN', but in percent.
    operation: OR
    # Again, a 'responsible' string can be specified in order not to inherit
    # from the parent BP.
    responsible: infra.team@example.com
    # And now the processes. Host and service relate to how you named those
    # things in your Icinga2 setup.
    services:
      - { host: haproxy1.example.com, service: ping } 
      - { host: haproxy2.example.com, service: ping }
  - name: App Nodes Availability
    id: app_availability
    operation: MINPERCENT 50
    services:
      - { host: app1.example.com, service: api_health, responsible: engineering.team@example.com }
      - { host: app2.example.com, service: api_health }
      - { host: app3.example.com, service: api_health }
      - { host: app4.example.com, service: api_health }
</code></pre>

<p>Place your business processes in a directory and point BPMON there to execute:</p>

<pre><code># bpmon -c ./cfg.yaml -s default -b ./bp.d/ run
</code></pre>

<h2 id="run">Run</h2>

<pre><code># bpmon -h
Montior business processes composed of Icinga checks
