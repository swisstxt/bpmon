See how you can track the history of your incidents.

## Write data to your Influx Database

Sometimes we need to keep track of our uptimes and incidents in order to report to customers etc. For that
matter BPMON provides the `write` subcommand. Given that the `default.store.connection` string is properly set, we can simply
write the data into the database by running:

```
bpmon write
```

BPMON does not come with a daemon mode or similar. In order to have a decent history of your business processes
simply run `bpmon write` with a scheduler such as [cron job](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html), 
[systemd.timer](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.timer.html), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), 
via [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or whatever you have at your disposal.

## Explore your data

Since Influx provides very simple interfaces to access your data such as its HTTP API you have a range of possibilities
to explore your data. Two very simple approches are the `dashboard` subcommand as well a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
dashboard

### The `dashboard` Subcommand

### The Grafana Dashboard

An other easy way to explore data written by BPMON (or in fact any data stored in an Influx database et al.) is Grafana. You'll
find a example dashboard in our [GitHub repositoy](https://github.com/unprofession-al/bpmon/blob/master/hacking/grafana/BusinessProcessesDashboard.json)
